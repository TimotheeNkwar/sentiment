🚀 Just finished building a sentiment analysis web app for airline tweets!

Using a Kaggle dataset of real tweets directed at US airlines, I trained a machine learning model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) to classify each tweet as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

I then deployed the project using Streamlit to make it interactive and accessible in your browser.

🔧 Tools used:
– Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
– Streamlit
– Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset (Kaggle)

💻 Code on GitHub 👉 [https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo](https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo)

This project helped me sharpen my NLP skills and understand the deployment process for ML apps. Thinking about adding BERT next!

Would love your feedback — have you built anything similar?

🙏 Thanks to @Codveda Technologies for the inspiration/support!
