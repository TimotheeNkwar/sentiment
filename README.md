🚀 Just finished building a sentiment analysis web app for airline tweets!

Using a Kaggle dataset of real tweets directed at US airlines, I trained a machine learning model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) to classify each tweet as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

I then deployed the project using Streamlit to make it interactive and accessible in your browser.

🔧 Tools used:
– Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
– Streamlit
– Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset (Kaggle)

This project helped me sharpen my NLP skills and understand the deployment process for ML apps. Thinking about adding BERT next!
